# cher
Don't you wish you could write like [@cher](https://twitter.com/cher)? I often do, and that's why I made this primitive cher generator.

## To run cher
Assuming you have ruby on your system, jump into your terminal, cd to the folder where you put `cher.rb` and type
`ruby cher.rb`. When prompted, type what you want to say and the program will translate it for you.

## The future
There are some plans for including word substitions and abbreviations, that might happen some day. If you want to contribute, pull requests are welcome.
